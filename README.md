Become a Movie Star - Trivia

A trivia game with four movie categories:
Romance, action, comedy, and family.

Each category has 8 to ten movies that have 3 questions each.

Each time a question is answered correctly or incorrectly, the question is removed from the question array.

If all of the questions of a movie run out, the movie is removed from the movie array.

If there are no more movies in a certain category, a modal pops up that alerts the user to pick a different category.

Every time a questions is answered correctly it will get added to the number of questions correctly answered that shows up at the bottom of the screen.

Every third question answered correctly will show a modal of a new chapter. There are 10 chapters.

If the questions run out and the user did not beat the game the user will be alerted with a modal that says the actress/actor gave up on her dream and that maybe the user can try again.

There are 105 questions and you only need to get 30 correct to win the game.
